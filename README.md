# MSPaCMAn: Microstructure and Segmentation-based Particle and Composition Analysis

**MSPaCMAn** is a Python toolkit for analyzing 3D micro-CT images of particles.  
It supports property extraction, greyscale histogram analysis, peak detection, and multi-phase quantification â€” 
considering partial volume blur for advanced mineral processing research.
