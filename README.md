# MSPaCMAn: Mounted Single Particle Compositional and Mineralogical Analyses

**MSPaCMAn** is a Python toolkit for analyzing 3D micro-CT images of particles.  
It supports property extraction, greyscale histogram analysis, peak detection, and multi-phase quantification â€” 
considering partial volume blur for advanced CT analyses.


## Installation

Install directly using pip:

pip install git+https://github.com/ShuvamGupta/mspacman.git

## Example usage
Refer mspacman.core_example_usage.py file

## Acknowledge
This project utilizes several open-source Python libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, 
Napari, tifffile, scikit-image, joblib, anndata, tqdm, pykuwahara, and standard Python libraries 
(os, glob, re, and gc). We gratefully acknowledge the developers and communities of these tools 
for enabling efficient scientific computing, visualization, image processing, and data analysis.
